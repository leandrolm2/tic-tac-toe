:wave: Hi everyone!

This's a Tic Tac Toe proposed to me as a challenge in order to improve my coding skills in javascript as well as to learn how to work with Node JS



## :boom: Chalengs

To make a funcitonal Tic Tac Toe, I faced some chalengs a long the way, challenges such as:
* Make it playable for two players
* Apply Tic Tac Toe Rules
* Recognize who won or if the match is a draw
* Display something that reminds Tic Tac Tie at the prompt
* Make the game replayable

## :video_game: Gameplay

The gameplay and commands of this game are pretty simple. You have to get three "X", case you are player 1, or "O", case you are player 2, in a row inside the player board.

The comands for playing the game are: 
* chose a letter between 'a,b,c'
* Chose a number between '0,1,2'
* If you get three marks in a row you won the game as in the examplo bellow 
_ 0,1,2
a|X,-,O|
b|-,X,O|
c|-,-,X|
